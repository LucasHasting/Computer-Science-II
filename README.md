# Computer-Science-II
This repository holds all programs made in my Computer Science II class. This class introduces object oriented programming so some files include objects and are included in the driver. Some projects will need to be viewed to determine the file to be compiled by g++.

# C++ Installation and Usage

The programs in this repository can be executed using the C++ language and the g++ compiler.

g++ for [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/), don't forget to add the binary to the [path environment variable](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/).

g++ can be installed on Linux using your favorite package manager.

Next, download the repo by downloading the [ZIP](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/downloading-files-from-github) or by using [git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git).

### Run from the command line
1. Find the location of the files you want to execute
2. Copy the path
3. go to the command line and run the following:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/files
   ```

## Compile and Execute
Compile the program:
```sh
g++ program-name.cpp
```

Executing the program in Windows:
```sh
a.exe
```

Executing the program in Linux/Mac:
```sh
./a.out
```
